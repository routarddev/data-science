# Big Data and Data Science small projects

### Tennis WTA:
- **Sports - Tennis**: Jupyter Notebook with all the steps to work with data related to the WTA and perform some ETL processes (extract data from source files, load into NoSQL database, transform data), data analysis and visualizations.

### Twitter Analysis:
- **save_credentials**: save your credentials in a json file to read from them. Never upload or make public your credentials.
- **search_api_example** (30-day premium endpoint): read the credentials previously saved in the file (specify the path as your convenience), connect to the Twitter API and perform a basic limited search. Change the 'env_name' parameter for your current app environment name.
